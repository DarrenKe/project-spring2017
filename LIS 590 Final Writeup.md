**Overview**
For the bus data, Matt and I aimed to examine whether or not CUMTD exhibits a service bias towards the UIUC community. When mapping our data, we did so with the intention to clearly mark what was on campus and what was not. To that end, we chose a map that would show us the bounds of the campus and mapped out the routes accordingly. While the routes are helpful, they don’t tell us the full story. Adding the stops each bus makes to our map allowed us to gain deeper insight. 
When looking at the routes in conjunction with the stops, it is clear that a vast majority of the stops CUMTD makes are outside of campus. In fact, if we don't look at stops that have an iStop attributes (free fare for UIUC students), we see that the majority is still outside campus proper. While of course anyone can board on iStop stops, this allows a simple way to visualize what is specifically “prioritized” for students and faculty by the CUMTD. In addition to examining the intersection of routes and stops, we also decided to take a look at distance traveled by the busses, in the form of bar charts! This chart allows us to see how much a given route travels and gives more insight to what is serviced and what isn't. Based on all of the above, we can safely assume that there is not a service bias, implicit or explicit.
**Strengths and Weaknesses**
We found strength in the fact that we first mapped out our data with Tableau. This gave us a great starting point as we then knew *precisely* what we wanted to get out of our visualization. We also are fortunate to work well as a team, both of us having different levels of expertise in different areas. Together, we were able to piece together a great visualization and debunk a common misconception that many in the greater CU community have regarding CUMTD. We were not able to capture as much as we had wanted, but we both agree that we were able to reach our personal end goal. 
**Wants and Wishes**
We wish we could have done something more flashy or perhaps interactive with our results (getting the simple, bespoke visualizations was somewhat easy). We’re aware this was not part of the assignment and is intended both to make the process clearer, easier, and more concise. Having the ability to manipulate things and play with the results a la Tableau (or bokeh, for that matter) makes for an interesting way to view the route and stop data, in that you can have different things highlighted as you select certain areas of town or campus, such as stops affected etc. More improvements could have been made if MTD had provided more data. It also would have been a great addition if we were able to strip out *just* the parts of the routes and stops that comprise the UIUC campus. This would enable a greater at-a-glance understanding and not require as much explanation. It would also be beneficial to add a more proper road map in the future, to further enhance this understanding. 
**Who Did What** 
We worked to make sure that any holes in the data (NULLs, zeroes, missing data) were either taken care of and dealt with appropriately, or inconsequential enough so as to not interfere with the visualization. In most cases, the problems we *did* encounter were trivial and didn’t take away from the end result or understanding of the visualization. For this section, I handled the writeup. I wanted to make sure I conveyed our process accurately, and gave enough description to what we were trying to find. That being said, Matt and I discussed our findings and made sure that we were both in agreement with how the visualizations came out and in our analyses before we committed anything to paper.
# Component 3:System for Receiving New Data (Darren Ke)
**Overview:**    I (Darren Ke) firstly take a look at all attributes, plotting histogram for continuous data and bar graph for categorical feature without knowing the column names and data type. This is the very first and general way to get a big picture of the whole data set. Then I plot the latitudes and longitude data across the world map to see the distribution. Later I want to explore the relationship between  the three categorical features with the label data using the 3D visualization. I convert the three categories as an vector (x,y,z), and specify a unique color for each kind of label.  Curious about how different labels changes over time, I divided the timeline into 20 bins and count the number of different labels in each bin. The last three types of visualization were done using plotly library, which needs registration in advance. 
**Strength:**
- (1)my function can give an outview of each attributes *without knowing* the datatype of each column, the column names, and the specific number of columns.
- (2)Further, my function explore the *relationship* between different features. 
- (3)Last but not least, my function gives an *interactive visualization* effect. 

**Weakness:** more relationships between different features should be explored and different visualization method should be used for one feature to give a more objective and comprehensive view. 
# Component 4: Narrative Report Around a Dataset (Ashni Shah)
The approach I took here was, first, gather some knowledge onto what are IMLS grants and study the dataset. To understand the meaning and significance of each field in the database I referred to the description document provided on the website along with the dataset. To get deeper first I replaced the missing values with null. Then to form a narrative around the dataset I started playing with the data and plotted the grant awarded amount with various measures such as program types, geographic entities, year, institute etc and went ahead with those plots that seemed informative and conveyed some story.The basic intention here was to understand the distribution of the grant award. The strength of this approach is that I explored all the possible distributions and then went ahead with the selected ones. To find the top contenders I used the word cloud visualization instead of plots and used the plots for more informative ones. The weakness of the visualization I think is that major part is covered by bar charts and because I am focusing more on the distribution of the grant amount the other aspects of the dataset are not explored. The further improvements which I wish I would have been able to do is categorize the institution type further on museums, library or academic institution and analyze the dataset further. The part 4, creating infographic was done by Ashni Shah using Tableau.
